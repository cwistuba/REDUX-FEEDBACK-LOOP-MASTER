# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

I created a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback. The feedback form collects data over 4 views, "How are you feeling today?", "How well are you understanding the content?", "How well are you being supported?", and "Any comments you want to leave?". The separate review page displays the current feedback values and a submit button. Once all steps are complete, the app saves the feedback in my database.
